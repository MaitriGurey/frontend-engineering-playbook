# 🚀 Frontend Engineering Playbook

Welcome to my personal frontend engineering resources. This repository is a collection of architectural patterns, system design deep-dives, and machine coding challenges.

The goal of this playbook is to document and to provide a high-quality learning resource for peers.

## 🏗️ What's Inside?

### 📐 [System Design](./system-design)
Focuses on the "Big Picture"—architecting complex frontends that are scalable, maintainable, and entity-agnostic.

### 💻 [Machine Coding (Coming Soon)](./machine-coding)
Practical implementations of complex UI components with a focus on **performance**, **accessibility (A11y)**, and **state management**.

### ⚡ More to come soon

## 📈 Contribution Graph
I use this repository to "Learn in Public." I aim for consistent, atomic updates that reflect my daily explorations into frontend architecture.
